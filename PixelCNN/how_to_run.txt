Running pixelcnn.cpp and pixelcnn_with_delay.cpp is like a normal c++ code.

Running st1_pixelcnn.cpp, st1_pixelcnn_with_delay.cpp, st2_barrier_apixelcnn.cpp, and st2_rowthreads_pixelcnn.cpp will require you to produce the output file using the "g++ -fopenmp file_name" command.

To run one code for multiple times and get an average run time runner.py code. 
In runner.py you can configure to run the code with different kernel and matrix sizes.
you also need to make sure you are running the correct c++ output file.
